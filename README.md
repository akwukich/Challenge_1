# LexisNexis AND Lexis+ AI

## Overview and Origin

The company we know as LexisNexis grew out of a concept developed in the 1960s by the Ohio State Bar Association (OHBA), led by James F. Preston and William G. Harrington. Their vision was electronic access to legal research, which they defined as 
>“non-indexed, full-text online, interactive, computer-assisted (CALR) service.” 

In pursuit of this access, the OHBA contracted with Ohio-based Data Corporation in 1967. The following year, Data Corporation was acquired by Mead Paper Company. In 1970, Mead Paper Company created a subsidiary, Mead Data Central, to continue work on the electronic legal research project, and ultimately was responsible for introducing Lexis, a legal database, in 1973. 

The original Lexis contained Ohio and New York codes and cases, the U.S. Code, and some Federal case law. In 1979, Mead Data Central, then led by Jerry Rubin, developed an additional service known as Nexis, a business and news research service made available alongside Lexis.

Throughout the 1980s, the Lexis service continued to grow, largely due to advances in personal computer accessibility. In 1994, Mead divested Mead Data Corporation, which was acquired by Reed Glevier plc, now known as RELX Group, plc. RELX Group, plc is a wholly owned subsidiary of RELX PLC, a publicly traded holding company. After the acquisition, Mead Data Central became known as LexisNexis.


## Business Activities

RELX Group, plc established LexisNexis Legal & Professional to address the **LegalTech Market** segment. LegalTech is a significant market valued between $10 billion and $30 Billion, depending on the source.

LexisNexis Legal & Professional is divided into three market groups: Law Firms and corporate Legal, Government and academic, and News and business. Collectively, the groups accounted for $2.3 billion in revenue for the year ending December 2023, 60% of which came from the Law Firms and Corporate Legal group.

LegalTech can be further divided into the following segments: LegalTech includes Research, Contract Management, E-Discovery, Practice and Case Management, and Intellectual Property. LexisNexis has been a leader in legal research for decades and has grown to become the self-proclaimed “world’s largest repository of accurate and legal content.” According to the [2023 Market Segment Report](https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/2023-ar-sections/relx-2023-market-segments.pdf), LexisNexis hosts 138 billion documents, both legal and news, and is adding more than 2 million legal documents every day. 

Subscribers can access this content through three subscription-based products: Lexis, the premium product Lexis+, and the newly released Lexis + AI. These subscriptions are generally multi-year and marketed directly to the consumer, law firms, and legal departments.  

The addition of Lexis+ AI has differentiated LexisNexis from its competitors. While the addition of generative AI for legal research is not unique to Lexis, LexisNexis’ approach to developing Lexis+ AI makes it unique. It was developed internally, and as a result integrated seamlessly and can be adapted and updated efficiently. It is also unique in that it is a multi-model LLM that supports both ChatGPT-4 in Azure and Anthropic in AWS, and is capable of using the best model based on the user’s query. 

In addition to accessing Lexis’ repository of billions of documents, and multiple language models, Lexis+ AI improved the validity of its responses by integrating its proprietary Shepard’s citation index tool into its responses, which reduces the chances of providing outdated or overruled case law.

## Landscape

LexisNexis is in the Legal Research segment of LegalTech. The field is evolving rapidly as access to generative AI has increased. In October 2023, LexisNexis announced its newest service Lexis+ AI, which combined generative AI with LexisNexis’ legal search technology, massive repository, and proprietary Shepard’s citations. The space is evolving rapidly, and as recently as April 2024, LexisNexis announced further enhancements to Lexis+ AI that included faster, more nuanced, and carefully crafted conversations, AI-assisted drafting, and AI-generated summaries for statutes.

In addition to exploring machine learning and generative AI, The LegalTech Industry has been evolving over the past decade, specifically focusing on transitioning from internally stored data and mainframes to cloud-based services. 

In the United States, LexisNexis’ main competitors are Westlaw, CCH, Bloomberg, and Factiva.



## Results

It is still too soon to know the true impact of Lexis+ AI and the implementation of generative AI by its competitors. Moving forward, it is likely the success of Lexis+ AI will be measured by several metrics beyond revenues and net profits, including:

- Average number of users and connections
- Average number of documents accessed
- Subscriptions, both new and renewals
- Overall customer satisfaction score
- Product Satisfaction and Net Promoter scores
- Average improvement in response times for queries and searches
- Average improvement in time and volume of data added to the repositories
- Number of hallucinations and accuracy scoring for responses
- Law student preferences


## Recommendations

If I were in a position to offer advice to LexisNexis, I would encourage them to do it “faster, better, and cheaper” as the legal industry embarks on a potentially tumultuous period of transition. To paraphrase Rahm Emanual, never let a crisis go to waste. Law firms and legal departments are being forced to do more with less: increasing productivity and cutting expenses allows LexisNexis to position itself as the most efficient and accurate legal research. 

I would also remind LexisNexis that for Lexis+ AI to succeed, lawyers actually have to use it. This means focusing on current and future lawyers. LexisNexis has always been strategic about targeting law students and garnering their favor early, and this must continue as its technology and services evolve. LexisNexis can’t forget its current users, many of whom have serious concerns and fears about generative AI. Time and resources must be dedicated to getting these users comfortable, paying particular attention to privacy and confidentiality concerns.

I would also encourage LexisNexis to continue to build internally. The seamless integration and rapid deployment create a consistent user experience that is appreciated, especially for lawyers, who can be resistant to, or wary of change. While I can’t think of additional technologies I would roll out, I would suggest expanding how generative AI is being used with current products. Generative AI can go beyond legal research and is already being used for drafting, but could integrate nicely with practice management tools to improve the overall efficacy of law firms and legal departments. The more places the legal community sees generative AI working, the more comfortable they will continue to become with it.
